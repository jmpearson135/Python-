    #print "Test" Does not work without parenthesis and  asks if I meant the
    #line with them.
    
    #print "Test") Forgetting either of the parenthesis has an error for missing
    #parenthesis. 
#2
    #print (Test") Trying to print with 1 quote causes an end of line error for that
    #string because there is only the one quotation.

    #print(Test) Came up with the error that Test is not defined because it is
    #looking for a variable named Test but we have not defined one.
#3
    #print (2++2) This did not seem to cause any issues I still got the correct
    #sum for any combination of numbers.
#4
    #If you put a zero infront of the 2 in the previous question it does cause a
    #problem in python so you can not have a leading zero in math problems.
#5
    #It causes an issue to have no operator between them it says there is a
    #syntax error at the 2nd number. They are treated as single values.

    #(42*60)+42 or (minutes * 60) + seconds, which is 2562.

#2
    #(10 / 1.61) or (KM / KM in mile) which is 6.211180124223602

#3
    #(6.21/2562)*3600 or (miles/seconds)*3600 to convert it from seconds to hours.

#2.1

    #1 If you have declared n already as a number or float 42 - n will work
    # however if not there will be an error because you  never defined n.
    
    #2 This line did work and it seemed to declare both x and y equal to 1.
    
    #3 It causes an error saying it reached the end of file while parsing.
    
    #4 Causes an error invalid syntax pointing to the peroid.
    
    #5 It will not work it is trying to find the variable xy instead of
    #multiplying them together as seperate variables.
    
#2.2
    #1 (4/3) * 3.14 * 5 ** 3 which is 523.3333333333334
    
    #2 (24.95 * 0.60) + 3 + (75 * 59) = 62.22
    #   to get book cost + first book shipping + shipping cost of remaining books
